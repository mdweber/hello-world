## Getting Started

### Branching
Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

By default your repository has one branch named ```master``` which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to ```master```.

When you create a branch off the ```master``` branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of ```master``` as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the ```master``` branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

This diagram shows:

- The ```master``` branch
- A new branch called ```feature``` (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch)
- The journey that ```featur```e takes before it’s merged into ```master```

### Commits
On GitHub, saved changes are called *commits*. Each commit has an associated *commit message*, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

### Pull Requests
Now that you have changes in a branch off of ```master```, you can open a pull request.

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a *pull request*, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show *diffs*, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

By using GitHub’s [@mention system](https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/#text-formatting-toolbar) in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.

You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub Flow before working on larger projects.
