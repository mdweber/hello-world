## Getting Started

Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

By default your repository has one branch named ```master``` which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to ```master```.

When you create a branch off the ```master``` branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of ```master``` as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the ```master``` branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

This diagram shows:

- The ```master``` branch
- A new branch called ```feature``` (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch)
- The journey that ```featur```e takes before it’s merged into ```master```

On GitHub, saved changes are called *commits*. Each commit has an associated *commit message*, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.
